- Port is a unique number for our application (or) A port is like a door number that directs network data to the correct application on a system.
- Better not to take port number like 8080, 3305 because it already taken by other app (mysql, jenkins)
- Whenver we want to access applcation from the server we need two things ( ip address and port of the application ), if we use public ip address then through internet we can access
  but if we use private ip address then within our private network we can access
