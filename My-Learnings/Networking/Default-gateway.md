A **default gateway** is the **IP address of a router that a device uses to send traffic to destinations outside its local network**.

**One-line simple version:**

> *The default gateway is like the “exit door” from your local network to the internet.*

**Example from your setup:**

* Your Wi-Fi IP: `192.168.1.5`
* Default Gateway: `192.168.1.1` → your home router

All traffic to websites like `google.com` goes **through this gateway**.
